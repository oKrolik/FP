"""
You're helping a teller decide how to give change.
Write a Python script that given the price of the sale 
and the amount received by user input, then prints a string indicating 
how many notes of each amount they have to give as change. 
Consider that the largest note available is the 50â‚¬ note and that all 
prices and amounts received are multiples of 5 (no coins!).

The result should be a string with the number of notes of each amount, 
separated by a space: "#50 #20 #10 #5".

in: '5', '20'	out: '0 0 1 1'

price = int(input())
amount = int(input())-price
print(amount//50, (amount%50)//20, (amount%50%20)//10, (amount%50%20%10)//5)
